. Returns and cancellations for buyers Buyers generally do not have the right to cancel an order. Buyers can request to cancel an order on eBay within the time period and as provided in our Order cancellation policy , and the seller will have 3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order cannot be canceled, buyers may still be permitted to return the item if the item is eligible for return . In certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an item returned to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the buyer may elect to use an eBay -generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label directly from a carrier. By choosing to use an eBay -generated shipping label, you (as a buyer) agree that eBay may deduct the cost of the shipping label from the refund owed to you
